# docker_compose_plex
Docker Compose for plex.nomorestars.local

THis is my working docker-compose file that I use to run ancillary services on my plex server.   This will create a PiHole server, an Ombi Server, a Taultilli Server, and the watchtower that will update the containers when there are new ones.

The Lancache is for caching local network steam downloads, was low on space so commented it out but it's fully working as well.
